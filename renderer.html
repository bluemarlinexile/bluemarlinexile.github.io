<h4>Renderers</h4>

<p>

<b>Writing you own renderer is no different from writing any other web pages. Bluemarlin loads any html page (using WebKit) located in the renderers directory:</b>

<br/>
<br/>There are two examples, classic and raw. Classic is the one used by default right now. Have a look at the raw renderer which simply displays the data in raw JSON:
<br/><a href="https://github.com/bluemarlinexile/bluemarlin/blob/0.1/bluemarlin/renderers/raw/index.html">https://github.com/bluemarlinexile/bluemarlin/blob/0.1/bluemarlin/renderers/raw/index.html</a>
<br/>The bluemarlin.properties file is where the location of the renderer is specified:
<br/><a href="https://github.com/bluemarlinexile/bluemarlin/blob/0.1/bluemarlin/config/bluemarlin.properties">https://github.com/bluemarlinexile/bluemarlin/blob/0.1/bluemarlin/config/bluemarlin.properties</a>
<br/>How these json data is displayed is all up to the html/js/css code. The example uses jquery, so you should be able to use any other js libraries as well.
<br/>It's also interesting to note that this renderer can be loaded from the internet instead of the local disk.
<br/><i>For development, You can also grab a sample json data (as seen in the raw renderer) and use that for testing - so you don't need to run bluemarlin, you can run your renderer in a browser.</i>
