There are currently two variables in the Search File:
1. $DEFAULT_LEAGUE - this will be replaced by config/bluemarlin.properties - league.default
1a. You can opt not to use this, and replace it with the actual league name instead
2. $renderer - this will let you specify which renderer will be used, if not set, config/bluemarlin.properties - renderer.default will be used instead
2a. The idea here is to be able to use a renderer that is tailored to the search. You might wanna show line graphs for an aggregate search for example. 
2b. You can also use renderer from the net, try hosting one on github pages, github gist
