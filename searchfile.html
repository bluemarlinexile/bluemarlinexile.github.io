<h4>Search File</h4>

<b>There are currently two variables in the Search File:</b>

<br/>1. $DEFAULT_LEAGUE - this will be replaced by config/bluemarlin.properties - league.default
<br/>1a. You can opt not to use this, and replace it with the actual league name instead
<br/>2. $renderer - this will let you specify which renderer will be used, if not set, config/bluemarlin.properties - renderer.default will be used instead
<br/>2a. The idea here is to be able to use a renderer that is tailored to the search. You might wanna show line graphs for an aggregate search for example. 
<br/>2b. You can also use renderer from the net, try hosting one on github pages, github gist
